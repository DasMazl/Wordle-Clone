Welcome to my personal wordle clone! I will keep working on this over time for fun and for practice.
I will work on the UI, will add more features later and lets see where this is going to go!

This works just as the classical Wordle. You can select a word length and a language. Currently supported: German and English.

You can choose between a word length of 3 to 8 characters.

Type in the letters per row. You can only use valid words (determined by a valid word list). The solution get chosen out of a solution word list.

If a letter is in its correct spot, it will turn green. If a letter is contained in the solution, but not on the correct spot, it will turn yellow. If the letter is not included at all it turns grey.

If you find any bugs please keep me posted! Always happy to hear suggestions.
